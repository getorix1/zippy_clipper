See README.txt for installation and compilation instructions. 

I am new to GitHub so expect confusion but all the code seems to be here.

The *.in files become *.c, *.h etc by action of the <i>make</i> command.

Make the file <i>configure</i> executable then:

configure && make -j 8 -B

where -j 8 means you have 8 cores on your cpu (adjust as needed)

Then run Zippy-bin and click Re-load Clips button. A sample video will be present.
